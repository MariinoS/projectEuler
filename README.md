# projectEuler. By MariinoS. Feb 7th 2016

This is my journey in completing every problem on ProjectEuler.net

In the master branch, I will put every working solution i created myself.

If I get stuck on a problem, I will create a new branch for it.
This way, only working solutions are situated in the master branch.

If anyone reads this and has some comments on how to make my code more efficient, please let me know!

Thanks for reading.

Ciao Ciao!
